    <h2 id="b">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Contemporary writing technology, with its array of different programs
      and applications, has transformed the means by which we communicate text.
      Both the form of composition--webpages, slideshows--and the methods of
      production--HTML, word processors--are but few examples of how writing
      practices have been "reinvented." However, these new methods and forms
      belie the fact that writing is itself a very old technology. The goal of
      this project is to demonstrate how modern writing technologies have
      adapted and repurposed older strategies of composition and rhetoric
      through the lens of one HTML element: &lt;Strong&gt;.

      <br><br>Christina Haas (1999) in her article, "On the Relationship Between
      Old and New Technologies," differentiates between two bifurcated models of
      technological development. On the one hand there is the <i>simple
      replacement model</i>, "which assumes that old and new technologies are
      clearly differentiated from one another, both theoretically and in
      practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete
      technologies" (p. 210). Conversely there is the <i>straightforward
      progress model</i>, a view that elevates new techology because of its
      superior efficiency and power over older technology (p. 210). In either
      case, there is an oversimplified disctinction between the old and new that
      attempts to leave behind older technology by downplaying its significance.
      Such facile cultural narratives distort the deep interconnectedness of
      technological development, particularly in the case of writing.

      <br><br>Regardless of the tool used, writing composition relies on
      rhetorical techniques to create emphasis and multidimensional meaning
      within a text. The &lt;strong&gt; element is one such technique. Examples
      of old technology such as "books, print, and physically present texts," as
      well as new "computer-generated and/or computer-delivered texts" (p. 211)
      both exhibit the use of &lt;strong&gt;. In this project I will first
      provide an overview of the &lt;strong&gt; element within the context of
      HTML. Then I will examine the rhetorical power of &lt;strong&gt; and how
      different writing technologies have adapted it to achieve different ends.
      Finally, I will conclude the project with a discussion of the current and
      potential future uses of &lt;strong&gt;.

    <h2 id="c">A Look at &lt;Strong&gt;</h2>
      <p>The purpose of the &lt;strong&gt; element is to give text strong
      semantic importance (Mozilla). Within HTML, &lt;strong&gt; is used on
      phrasing content typically found in paragraphs (Mozilla). It is important
      to note, however, that while &lt;strong&gt; often displays text as bold,
      it does not necessarily have to. This is one of the major distinctions
      between the &lt;strong&gt; element and the &lt;b&gt; (bold) element. The
      &lt;strong&gt; element is what can be referred to as a logical state,
      which works to seperate form from content (Mozilla). This means that
      &lt;strong&gt; text can be expressed in many different ways while still
      keeping its strong importance. For example, instead of having
      &lt;strong&gt; content display as bold, one could have it underlined or
      even rendered as a different font color. The &lt;b&gt; element on the
      other hand is a physical state, meaning that there is no seperation of
      form and content (Mozilla). The &lt;b&gt; element will simply bold text
      without semantically increasing its importance. In other words, it is
      purely presentational.

      <br><br>Another development, or refinement, of &lt;strong&gt; can be found
      in its distinction with the &lt;em&gt; (emphasis) element. Although both
      are logical states in the sense that their functions do not depend on
      visual output, the &lt;strong&gt; element is what actually designates the
      hierarchy of content importance. The &lt;em&gt; element is used primarily
      as a guide for computer text readers to know where to add stress in a
      sentence. Additionally, changing the importance of a piece of text
      using the &lt;strong&gt; element does not change the meaning of the text,
      whereas with the &lt;em&gt; element, the meaning can change depending on
      where in the sentence the stress is located (W3C). Yet despite these
      important differences, it was not until the publication of the HTML5
      specification in 2014 that this distinction was made. Prior to the release
      of HTML5, &lt;strong&gt; was used primarily for situations in which "a
      stronger emphasis" was needed (Mozilla). Not only was this use of
      &lt;strong&gt; redundant, it also severely limited the rhetorical
      potential of the element within a text. Since the transition from HTML4 to
      HTML5, however, the sytax has undergone marked improvements to help
      seperate content from presentation (Hoy, 2011, 52).

    <h2 id="d">Rhetorical Use of &lt;Strong&gt;</h2>
      <p>I began this project by noting that modern writing technologies have
      largely adapted and repurposed older strategies of composition and
      rhetoric. One such strategy exhibited by HTML's &lt;strong&gt; element is
      the utilizing of the power of rhetoric to direct thought
      (Herrick, 2013, 193). As a result of &lt;strong's&gt; semantic function to
      designate the relative importance of textual content, the element is
      strategically situated to guide and enhance a text's rhetorical impact.
