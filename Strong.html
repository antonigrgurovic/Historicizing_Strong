    <h2 id="b">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Contemporary writing technology, with its array of different programs
      and applications, has transformed the means by which we communicate text.
      Both the form of composition--webpages, slideshows--and the methods of
      production--HTML, word processors--are but few examples of how writing
      practices have been "reinvented." However, these new methods and forms
      belie the fact that writing is itself a very old technology. The goal of
      this project is to demonstrate how modern writing technologies have
      adapted and repurposed older strategies of composition and rhetoric
      through the lens of one HTML element: &lt;Strong&gt;.

      <br><br>Christina Haas (1999) in her article, "On the Relationship Between
      Old and New Technologies," differentiates between two bifurcated models of
      technological development. On the one hand there is the <i>simple
      replacement model</i>, "which assumes that old and new technologies are
      clearly differentiated from one another, both theoretically and in
      practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete
      technologies" (p. 210). Conversely there is the <i>straightforward
      progress model</i>, a view that elevates new techology because of its
      superior efficiency and power over older technology (p. 210). In either
      case, there is an oversimplified disctinction between the old and new that
      attempts to leave behind older technology by downplaying its significance.
      Such facile cultural narratives distort the deep interconnectedness of
      technological development, particularly in the case of writing.

      <br><br>Regardless of the tool used, writing composition relies on
      rhetorical techniques to create emphasis and multidimensional meaning
      within a text. The &lt;strong&gt; element is one such technique. Examples
      of old technology such as "books, print, and physically present texts," as
      well as new "computer-generated and/or computer-delivered texts" (p. 211)
      both exhibit the use of &lt;strong&gt;. In this project I will first
      provide an overview of the &lt;strong&gt; element within the context of
      HTML. Then I will examine the rhetorical power of &lt;strong&gt; and how
      different writing technologies have adapted it to achieve similar ends.
      Finally, I will conclude the project with a discussion of the current and
      potential future uses of &lt;strong&gt;.

    <h2 id="c">A Look at &lt;Strong&gt;</h2>
      <p>The purpose of the &lt;strong&gt; element is to give text strong
      semantic importance (Mozilla). Within HTML, &lt;strong&gt; is used on
      phrasing content typically found in paragraphs (Mozilla). It is important
      to note, however, that while &lt;strong&gt; often displays text as bold,
      it does not necessarily have to. This is one of the major distinctions
      between the &lt;strong&gt; element and the &lt;b&gt; (bold) element. The
      &lt;strong&gt; element is what can be referred to as a logical state,
      which works to seperate form from content (Mozilla). This means that
      &lt;strong&gt; text can be expressed in many different ways while still
      keeping its strong importance. For example, instead of having
      &lt;strong&gt; content display as bold, one could have it underlined or
      even rendered as a different font color. The &lt;b&gt; element on the
      other hand is a physical state, meaning that there is no seperation of
      form and content (Mozilla). The &lt;b&gt; element will simply bold text
      without semantically increasing its importance. In other words, it is
      purely presentational.

      <br><br>Another development, or refinement, of &lt;strong&gt; can be found
      in its distinction with the &lt;em&gt; (emphasis) element. Although both
      are logical states in the sense that their functions do not depend on
      visual output, the &lt;strong&gt; element is what actually designates the
      hierarchy of content importance. The &lt;em&gt; element is used primarily
      as a guide for computer text readers to know where to add stress in a
      sentence. Additionally, changing the importance of a piece of text
      using the &lt;strong&gt; element does not change the meaning of the text,
      whereas with the &lt;em&gt; element, the meaning can change depending on
      where in the sentence the stress is located (W3C). Yet despite these
      important differences, it was not until the publication of the HTML5
      specification in 2014 that this distinction was made. Prior to the release
      of HTML5, &lt;strong&gt; was used primarily for situations in which "a
      stronger emphasis" was needed (Mozilla). Not only was this use of
      &lt;strong&gt; redundant, it also severely limited the rhetorical
      potential of the element within a text. Since the transition from HTML4 to
      HTML5, the sytax of HTML has undergone marked improvements to help
      seperate content from presentation (Hoy, 2011, 52).

    <h2 id="d">Rhetorical Use of &lt;Strong&gt;</h2>
      <p>I began this project by noting that modern writing technologies have
      largely adapted and repurposed older strategies of composition and
      rhetoric. One such strategy exhibited by HTML's &lt;strong&gt; element is
      the utilizing of the power of rhetoric to direct thought
      (Herrick, 2013, 193). As a result of &lt;strong's&gt; semantic function to
      designate the relative importance of textual content, the element is
      strategically situated to guide and enhance a text's rhetorical impact.
      Specifically, &lt;strong&gt; reveals the hidden assumptions and
      implications of a text by drawing attention to the areas which the author
      has chosen to make salient (Herrick, 2013, 195).

      <br><br>What better example to demonstrate this effect than through the
      artifacts of scientific enquiry. The rhetoric of science,
      according to rhetorical theorist Herbert Simons, relies "on rhetorical
      appeals and arguments in the forging of a discipline" (p. 197). "This
      observation has been difficult for some members of the natural and social
      science communities to accept, for these academic endeavors have promoted
      themselves as objective and aloofness from the irrational realm of
      <strong>persuasion</strong>. But, the posture of objectivity may itself be
      rhetorical in nature, a strategy intended to persuade the public that
      science is the one rhetoric-free zone of human activity. Science thus
      assumes the status of a protected domain in which critical examination of
      motives and persuasive tactics is inappropriate" (Herrick, 2013, 197).
      This posture of objectivity has in fact allowed a proliferation of
      rhetorical maneuvering to better position the products of scientific
      study. To illustrate this, let us look at one of the most common items
      found in American supermarkets: Milk.
      <br><img src="http://guidingbyte.com/modo/milklabelFULL.png"
      alt="Milk Label" style="width:300px;height:300px;">

      <br><br>This here is a label for a gallon of milk from Sunrise Dairy,
      virtually identical in content to any other company's milk label. It
      identifies the type of milk it is, the nutritional information, the
      ingredients, and includes the ubiquitious disclaimer about rBST/rBGH.
      These two terms are equivalent and simply refer to genetically
      engineered bovine growth hormone (The Organic &#38; Non-GMO Report, 2007).
      Now, contained within the disclaimer are all three functions of the
      &lt;strong&gt; element that help guide and enhance a text's rhetorical
      impact. The heading of the disclaimer designates importance (W3C), i.e.,
      it directs the thoughts of the reader (or consumer) to fixate on the fact
      that the gallon of milk contains no rBST. The bold, black font of the
      heading also designates the seriousness of the disclaimer (W3C). With the
      exception of the nutrition facts, only what is inside the yellow text box
      is in black, a color combination indicative of standard caution signs.
      Lastly, the heading suggests an increased level of urgency because it
      denotes content that the reader needs to see sooner than other parts of
      the label (W3C), namely, the sentence in small letters that comes after
      the asterisk.

      <br><br>The result of this seemingly non-technoligical use of
      &lt;strong&gt; in a physically present text is, for all intents and
      purposes, the same as if &lt;strong&gt; were used on a computer-generated
      webpage. "It directs us to <em>look at</em> some things and
      <em>overlook</em> others" (Herrick, 2013, 212). The designation of
      importance within this body of text actually reveals several implications
      and assumptions that Sunrise Dairy wants its customers to believe. First,
      Sunrise Dairy wants to position itself as actively concerned for the
      welfare of its customers. The bold text inside of the yellow background
      suggests that rBST/rBGH is somehow bad for consumers, and that Sunrise
      Dairy is taking proactive measures to both caution and reassure its
      customers. However, underneath the bold text is the neutralizing
      sentence in small print that explains there is in fact no
      <strong>significant</strong> difference between cows who have been
      treated with rBST and those who have not. This pellucid sentence should
      technically deflate the bold text above, but instead it supports it.
      The use of "significant difference" implies that scientific research
      was conducted, and even though the differences might have been marginal,
      non-rBST treated cows are slightly healthier and that is why their milk
      is preferred by Sunrise Dairy. Never is the customer's thought directed
      towards the possiblity that underneath the label is a monetary motive;
      that the main reason why non-rBST cows are used is simply because their
      milk is more profitable since artifical ingredients like rBST, once
      widely known, have a tendency to frighten the public.

    <h2 id="e">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Though it has taken time for the &lt;strong&gt; element to mature its
      rhetorical potentiality in HTML, clearly it is not a new invention.
      Print media has been utilizing the functions of
      &lt;strong&gt;--importance; seriousness; urgency--well before it became
      an element with its own definition and specification. As pointed out by
      Haas, the simple replacement model and the straightforward progress
      model do not and cannot tell a coherent narrative of technological
      development. Soft technology such as the &lt;strong&gt; element has a rich
      history of rhetorical usage and strategy. Just given the enhancements of
      &lt;strong's&gt; rhetorical pontential going from HTML4 to HTML5, my own
      estimation is that &lt;strong&gt; will continue to develop in
      functionality and applicability in future specifications. Nothing in the
      world of rhetoric remains static, be it print content, digital content,
      or some new technology just beyond our horizon.
