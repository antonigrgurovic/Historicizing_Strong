      <p>Contemporary writing technology, with its array of different programs
      and applications, has transformed the means by which we communicate text.
      Both the form of composition--webpages, slideshows--and the methods of
      production--HTML, word processors--are but few examples of how writing
      practices have been "reinvented." However, these new methods and forms
      belie the fact that writing is itself a very old technology. The goal of
      this project is to demonstrate how modern writing technologies have
      adapted and repurposed older strategies of composition and rhetoric.
