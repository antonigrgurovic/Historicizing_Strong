    <h2 id="b">Introduction<h2>
      <p>Contemporary writing technology, with its array of different programs
      and applications, has transformed the means by which we communicate text.
      Both the form of composition--webpages, slideshows--and the methods of
      production--HTML, word processors--are but few examples of how writing
      practices have been "reinvented." However, these new methods and forms
      belie the fact that writing is itself a very old technology. The goal of
      this project is to demonstrate how modern writing technologies have
      adapted and repurposed older strategies of composition and rhetoric
      through the lens of one HTML element: &lt;Strong&gt;.

      <br><br>Christina Haas (1999) in her article, "On the Relationship Between
      Old and New Technologies," differentiates between two bifurcated models of
      technological development. On the one hand there is the <i>simple
      replacement model</i>, "which assumes that old and new technologies are
      clearly differentiated from one another, both theoretically and in
      practice, and that new technologies simply replace older, obsolete
      technologies" (p. 210). Conversely there is the <i>straightforward
      progress model</i>, a view that elevates new techology because of its
      superior efficiency and power over older technology (p. 210). In either
      case, there is an oversimplified disctinction between the old and new that
      attempts to leave behind older technology by downplaying it significance.
      Such facile cultural narratives distort the deep interconnectedness of
      technological development, particularly in the case of writing.

      <br><br>Regardless of the tool used, writing composition relies on
      rhetorical techniques to create emphasis and multidimensional meaning
      within a text. The &lt;strong&gt; element is one such technique. Examples
      of old technology such as "books, print, and physically present texts," as
      well as new "computer-generated and/or computer-delivered texts" (p. 211)
      both exhibit the use of &lt;strong&gt;. In this project I will first
      provide an overview of the &lt;strong&gt; element within the context of
      HTML. Then I will examine the rhetorical power of &lt;strong&gt; and how
      different writing technologies have adapted it to achieve different ends.
      Finally I will conclude the project with a discussion of the current and
      potential future uses of &lt;strong&gt;.
